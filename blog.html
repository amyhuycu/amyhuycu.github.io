			<div class="blogheader">A Year In Review: Highlights of 2020</div>
			This year has been a year of a lot of growth and learning for me. Looking back, I am very proud of how far I have come since last year, and of how much growth I have been able to achieve. To wrap up the end of 2020, I compiled a list of things that I did, and experiences that I am grateful to have had.
			<ol>
				<li>
					<div class="blogsubheader">Some Intel on Intel</div>
				</li> <br>
				At the beginning of this year, I worked at my first internship, which was an extremely valuable experience for me. Although this marked my fifth paid job since the age of fifteen, I would consider it to be my first “grown-up” job, as it came with a lot of new “firsts”. <br><br>
				From January to June of 2020, I interned with a Visual Technologies Team at Intel Corporation, in which I worked on developing Performance Analysis tools. It was my first time working with “real adults”, which meant that they were supposed to be considered as my “coworkers”, rather than just my “supervisors”. This was definitely a tough thing to wrap my mind around, and I couldn’t help but feel very young the entire time. (This was definitely due to my own self-consciousness, as my team was incredibly friendly and supportive, and did everything to help me feel welcome and included.) It was also my first time in an office job, where I was expected to report to work from 8am to 5pm five days a week. I had my own desk and computer setup in my cubicle, which made it all seem very professional and grown-up to me. Perhaps most importantly, it was my first job that would give me a start on my career path. This meant that it was an essential opportunity to learn and gain as much experience as I could, and also hopefully to perform well and make good impressions. <br><br>
				I definitely learned a lot of new skills during this time as I worked on a multitude of different projects and gained bits of insight into each one. This allowed me to explore and gain clarity on my interests within the field of Software Engineering. <br><br>
				I also was able to gain some “soft skills” in communication and time management. I learned how and when to effectively ask questions, as well as balanced upwards of six different projects at a time. This experience also helped me to find more confidence in my own abilities, and to know that I am more capable than I had thought I was. <br><br>

				<li>
					<div class="blogsubheader">Folsom: The Place Where the West Came and Stayed</div>
				</li> <br>

				My first internship was a major milestone for me, both for my professional career goals as well as my own personal development. Because of this, I think my entire experience in Folsom deserves its own section as well. <br><br>
				I interned with Intel at its Folsom office location, which meant that I needed to move out and rent a new apartment for the duration. For me, this was distinct from the experience of moving out for college because in this case, I wasn’t transitioning into a convenient, comfortable freshman-dorm lifestyle, but I was instead moving to a new city where everything was unfamiliar and I didn’t know anybody. <br><br>
				This made it difficult and lonely at first, but I am also grateful because it pushed me to step out of my comfort zone and actively reach out to make friends. A key thing that I’ve learned is that people generally want to make friends, and that the experiences and memories gained from a friendship far outweighs any initial awkwardness of approaching new people. <br><br>
				This time was also significant for me because I was able to experience social life as a young adult in a new city with new people (and without real responsibilities or homework). I also had a car for the first time, which gave me the freedom and independence to go wherever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I became friends with a lot of the other interns during this time, where we met for lunch together every day, and would go explore new places after work and over the weekends. I am very thankful for them, as for what could have been a more stressful and lonely situation, they were a breath of fresh air and fun. <br><br>

				<li>
					<div class="blogsubheader">IBM: I've Been Moved (Back Home)</div>
				</li> <br>
				I interned with IBM for the second half of 2020, which had by then become an entirely virtual internship. During this experience, I worked for the company’s DB2 database division, and was able to cultivate my coding and project design skills, as well as bolster my confidence in my work. I am also glad to have worked with encouraging and supportive mentors, as well as form genuine friendships with my team members along the way.<br><br>
				In comparison to how I had begun my first internship with Intel, I am definitely a stronger programmer and communicator now, and I am definitely thankful to have had the cumulative year-long experience of both internships. <br><br>

			<div class="blogheader">10 Things I've Learned in 2020 (So Far!)</div>
			<ol>
				<li><b><u>Ask questions when you need help. </u></b>
				</li>
				It is far better to ask for help when you are stuck than to spend excessively unneeded time on a wrong path.<br>
				Ask for advice on the best ways to approach things, especially if it is a new and unfamiliar task.<br>
				A good way to make sure you understand is to repeat the instructions in your own words, so the other person will either confirm your knowledge or correct you, usually with more detail. <br>

				<li><b><u>Know what you don’t know.</u></b>
				</li>
				This helps make things more efficient because you know what specific questions to ask.<br>
				Prepare as many in-depth questions as you can using any resources available, but ask questions sparingly depending on who the questions are directed at (Know your audience!). Decide which questions are the most important to ask, and which you can correctly infer the answers from. This shows that you have done your research and that you respect the other person’s time.<br>

				<li><b><u>Own up to what you do know.</u></b>
				</li>
				It’s ok (and expected) to not know everything, but be proud of what you do know and what you have achieved.<br>
				Explain your projects with sufficient detail for your audience, but try to avoid being vague, since it could most likely lower others’ perceptions of your skills.<br>

				<li><b><u>Always try your best.</u></b>
				</li>
				Even if you don’t get the results that you wanted, the fact that you worked hard will speak for your work ethics and your efforts will be recognized.<br>
				Pay attention to the details, and put your all into your work because this shows your respect for the project, the team, and yourself.<br>

				<li><b><u>It's ok to hard-code.</u></b>
				</li>
				Hard-coding can help you to understand the general workings of projects before diving into a specific task. <br>
				Hard-coding is also useful as a temporary workaround to avoid being blocked by a single issue, but always remember to resolve the hard-coding later on.<br>

				<li><b><u>Take notes.</u></b>
				</li>
				Especially during phone calls or verbal instruction, take notes to remember important points. Review and annotate the notes immediately after they are given, since this is the time when you will remember most of the delivered content.<br>
				Document all notes, including emails or IMs, and keep a written record of the assignment instructions and the resources used for future reference. These notes will be helpful if you encounter a similar problem later on.<br>

				<li><b><u>Say "Yes" to spending time with others.</u></b>
				</li>
				(Within a reasonable extent. Be sure of your time and commitment priorities first.)<br>
				Joining the team for lunch or café runs can help to build community and interpersonal relationships and can also help them to get to know you outside of your work.<br>
				Spend time with your friends, and make new friends, because they can introduce you to new experiences. You can always make connections with others, even if they seem very different from you at first glance.<br>

				<li><b><u>Don't be so guarded.</u></b>
				</li>
				Smile, and be open to letting others get to know you. Don’t try to force relationships, but don’t be afraid of “losing” friendships either. Each person comes into your life at a different time, and for a different reason. <br>
				Don’t be afraid of judgement. Most likely, people won’t remember what you say or do, no matter how awkward it seems. The more relaxed you act, the more comfortable you will be.<br>

				<li><b><u>Don't take things too personally.</u></b>
				</li>
				Sometimes people can be having a bad day, but that doesn’t mean that it has anything to do with you. <br>
				Read positive tones and intent in ambiguous situations, especially in IMs or emails.<br>
				Be forgiving. Everyone is at a different place in life from you, and not everyone has had the same experiences as you have.<br>

				<li><b><u>Express gratitutde.</u></b>
				</li>
				Tell people “Thank you” when they help you. Being specific is generally more effective, but keep it conversational, and don’t make it seem forced.<br>
				Show appreciation for others’ compliments of you or recognition of your achievements. <br>
				Make “Thank You” notes specific to the person they are written for. Recall a memory you shared with them, and thank them for the positives and intent of what they did, but don’t be insincere.<br>
