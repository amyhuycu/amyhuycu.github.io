			<div class="blogheader">10 Things I've Learned in 2020 (So Far!)</div>
			<ol>
				<li><b><u>Ask questions when you need help. </u></b>
				</li>
				It is far better to ask for help when you are stuck than to spend excessively unneeded time on a wrong path.<br>
				Ask for advice on the best ways to approach things, especially if it is a new and unfamiliar task.<br>
				A good way to make sure you understand is to repeat the instructions in your own words, so the other person will either confirm your knowledge or correct you, usually with more detail. <br>

				<li><b><u>Know what you don’t know.</u></b>
				</li>
				This helps make things more efficient because you know what specific questions to ask.<br>
				Prepare as many in-depth questions as you can using any resources available, but ask questions sparingly depending on who the questions are directed at (Know your audience!). Decide which questions are the most important to ask, and which you can correctly infer the answers from. This shows that you have done your research and that you respect the other person’s time.<br>

				<li><b><u>Own up to what you do know.</u></b>
				</li>
				It’s ok (and expected) to not know everything, but be proud of what you do know and what you have achieved.<br>
				Explain your projects with sufficient detail for your audience, but try to avoid being vague, since it could most likely lower others’ perceptions of your skills.<br>

				<li><b><u>Always try your best.</u></b>
				</li>
				Even if you don’t get the results that you wanted, the fact that you worked hard will speak for your work ethics and your efforts will be recognized.<br>
				Pay attention to the details, and put your all into your work because this shows your respect for the project, the team, and yourself.<br>

				<li><b><u>It's ok to hard-code.</u></b>
				</li>
				Hard-coding can help you to understand the general workings of projects before diving into a specific task. <br>
				Hard-coding is also useful as a temporary workaround to avoid being blocked by a single issue, but always remember to resolve the hard-coding later on.<br>

				<li><b><u>Take notes.</u></b>
				</li>
				Especially during phone calls or verbal instruction, take notes to remember important points. Review and annotate the notes immediately after they are given, since this is the time when you will remember most of the delivered content.<br>
				Document all notes, including emails or IMs, and keep a written record of the assignment instructions and the resources used for future reference. These notes will be helpful if you encounter a similar problem later on.<br>

				<li><b><u>Say "Yes" to spending time with others.</u></b>
				</li>
				(Within a reasonable extent. Be sure of your time and commitment priorities first.)<br>
				Joining the team for lunch or café runs can help to build community and interpersonal relationships and can also help them to get to know you outside of your work.<br>
				Spend time with your friends, and make new friends, because they can introduce you to new experiences. You can always make connections with others, even if they seem very different from you at first glance.<br>

				<li><b><u>Don't be so guarded.</u></b>
				</li>
				Smile, and be open to letting others get to know you. Don’t try to force relationships, but don’t be afraid of “losing” friendships either. Each person comes into your life at a different time, and for a different reason. <br>
				Don’t be afraid of judgement. Most likely, people won’t remember what you say or do, no matter how awkward it seems. The more relaxed you act, the more comfortable you will be.<br>

				<li><b><u>Don't take things too personally.</u></b>
				</li>
				Sometimes people can be having a bad day, but that doesn’t mean that it has anything to do with you. <br>
				Read positive tones and intent in ambiguous situations, especially in IMs or emails.<br>
				Be forgiving. Everyone is at a different place in life from you, and not everyone has had the same experiences as you have.<br>

				<li><b><u>Express gratitutde.</u></b>
				</li>
				Tell people “Thank you” when they help you. Being specific is generally more effective, but keep it conversational, and don’t make it seem forced.<br>
				Show appreciation for others’ compliments of you or recognition of your achievements. <br>
				Make “Thank You” notes specific to the person they are written for. Recall a memory you shared with them, and thank them for the positives and intent of what they did, but don’t be insincere.<br><br>
